  <!-- Note: -->
  For the TDD, I am yet to get adept at writing tests (Jest API to be specific) to ensure scalable, maintainable, and robust software for better deliverance and overall user experience. This layer is fascinating and I am thrilled to dive deeper and learn both Unit and E2E Testing.
  For the lack of timing yet next time I will make sure to reward myself and the potential team with production-grade testable code.

  ### Instructions

  - You can fork the repository on your local machine and run <code>npm install</code> to install dependencies.
